# nonograms


The rules are simple.
Your aim in these puzzles is to colour the whole grid in to black and white squares or mark with X. Beside each row of the grid are listed the lengths of the runs of black squares on that row. Above each column are listed the lengths of the runs of black squares in that column.

These numbers tell you the runs of black squares in that row/column. So, if you see '10 1', that tells you that there will be a run of exactly 10 black squares, followed by one or more white square, followed by a single black square. There may be more white squares before/after this sequence. If you see 0 (zero) it means - "I'm not telling you how many squares", so a column/row can contain any number of squares or gaps.
